        INT. MOUNT ROYAL UNIVERSITY (COMPUTER LAB) - NIGHT
        <br />
        <br />
        MATTHEW HRE is sitting on the floor next to the door of the lab.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="dialogue">
          <h3>MATTHEW HRE</h3>
          I'm Matthew, and I'm a web designer. I'm also a cinematographer.
          Behind the camera is Sir Roger Deakins, one of the most acclaimed
          cinematographers (beat) in modern history. They're using a five wheel
          swivel chair in the lab B103 at Mount Royal University's campus (beat)
          in order to give you this smooth camera movement. Now it's quite an
          impressive feat to just use an iPhone and a camera, but little do you
          know, it's currently being propped up on a twelve-dollar Value Village
          leather jacket.
        </div>
        <br />
        Loud background noises. MATTHEW looks startled, and his voice is raised.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="dialogue">
          <h3>MATTHEW HRE</h3>
          (CONT'D) Roger Deakins is now grabbing a second - I repeat, a second
          chair, and putting it next to the table. He's grabbing the first
          chair, pulling it back, knocking the phone over in the process.
          Putting it back up, and going this way. I'm about to be off the
          frame... I'm still in the frame. We're good, Roger.
        </div>
        <br />
        A long, awkward silence. MATTHEW looks at the camera, proud, as it pulls
        away.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="dialogue">
          <h3>MATTHEW HRE</h3>
          (CONT'D) We're pulling even further back... I miss you...
        </div>

        <br />
        ROGER begins pushing the camera back towards MATTHEW.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="dialogue">
          <h3>MATTHEW HRE</h3>
          (CONT'D) Not that much. (beat) Web design. It's all about designing
          the web. What is there to say about web design? Roger? What... what is
          there to say about web design?
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>ROGER DEAKINS (Taylor Amy in disguise)</h3>
          (O.S.) Web design sucks.
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>MATTHEW HRE</h3>
          Web design sucks. Web design died with God, as you can read in the
          "when" section of my website; we talk about the death of God.
        </div>
        <br />
        MATTHEW's grin fades. He has become aware of the absurdity of this part
        of the assignment.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="dialogue">
          <h3>MATTHEW HRE</h3>
          (CONT'D) I really don't know why you need a video on this website this
          is... This is stupid, this is stupid! I think it's stupid, noone does
          anything that's not a YouTube link on their website anymore so why is
          this here? What purpose does this serve? Noone... Noone puts videos on
          their website anymore, like that's dead, right? Noone does this!
          [inaudible] a Spotify link! This is stupid, two minutes, we're done.
        </div>
        <br />
        MATTHEW turns off the camera.
        <br />
        <br />
        FIN.
