          <h2>rorschach</h2>
          <small>december 23, 2019. re-released january 19, 2021.</small>
          <p>
            rorschach plus is a precise, experimental puzzle platformer where
            you use paint to reveal your surroundings. platforming through the
            levels is only half the challenge, the other is figuring out exactly
            what you're platforming through.
          </p>

          <p>
            rorschach plus is a re-release of rorschach, made by a friend of
            mine. it featured a total mechanic overhaul, new levels, and a new
            soundtrack. the original jam version of rorschach can be found

          <p>
            this is a website i made to showcase my work and skills. it's
            currently a work in progress, and i'm still adding features and
            content. it's built with nextjs, and is hosted on vercel.
          </p>
          <p>
            it was originally built with react, but I decided to switch to
            nextjs for easier routing and seo. It also makes api access
            significantly easier. i'm currently working on adding a blog using
            firebase.

          <small>December 9, 2022</small>
          <p>
            This is a website I made for my Comp 1501 class. It's a simple page
            full of interactive Python practice problems to prepare for the
            final exam. It's built with raw React, and uses Tailwind for
            styling.
          </p>
          <p>
            I fought over how to style the page for a while, but eventually
            settled on Tailwind. I'm not a huge fan of the class-based styling,
            but for a simple page like this it works well.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was also a fun exploration into code snippets for React. There
            are a ton of libraries for this, and a good amount of them were
            absolutely terrible.
